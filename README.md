- Project focused on Unicorn private companies with a valuation over $1 billion as of March 2022, including each company's current valuation, funding, country of origin, industry, select investors, and the years they were founded and became unicorns while drawing inferences and information that companies looking to attain this status could emulate or adopt.
- Python was used as my ETL and Visualization tool, adopting Jupyter as the Integrated Development Environment.
- Raw Data set received was cleaned and transformed to obtain new features that are needed for proper analysis and inferences.
- Inferences from Data set are shown in Powerpoint presentation with facts deduced.
